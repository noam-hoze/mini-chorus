# Project: MiniChorus Requirements

## Objective

Create a simplified web application to display, search, and manage a collection of mock sales calls, inspired by the Chorus Engagement product.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

- [x] **View:** Main landing page of the application.
- [x] **Content:** Display a list of all available sales calls.
- [x] **List Item Details:** Each call in the list should display:
  - [x] Call Title
  - [x] Rep name
  - [x] Call date
  - [x] Sentiment score
- [x] **Interaction:** Clicking a call navigates to the "Call Detail Page" for that call.
- [ ] **Search & Filter:**
  - [ ] An input field dynamically filters the list of calls by title or participant as the user types.

### 2. Call Detail Page (`/call/:id`)

- [x] **View:** Displays complete information for a single, selected sales call.
- [x] **Content:**
  - [x] **Call Summary:** Title, Date, Participants.
  - [x] **Sentiment:** A visual indicator of the call's sentiment (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative).
  - [x] **Transcript:** Full conversation transcript.
  - [x] **Next Steps:** List of action items or key takeaways.
- [x] **Call Tagging:**
  - [x] A form allows the user to add tags (e.g., "Urgent," "Pricing Mention").
  - [x] Display existing tags for the call.

---

## Technical Requirements

- [x] **Framework:** Angular 17+
- [x] **Component Architecture:** Use Standalone Components.
- [x] **Routing:**
  - [x] Implement lazy loading for the Dashboard and Call Detail routes.
  - [x] Configure a redirect from the root path (`''`) to `/dashboard`.
- [ ] **State Management:**
  - [ ] Use NgRx to manage application state (e.g., call list, filters, selected call).
- [x] **Forms:**
  - [x] Use Angular's Reactive Forms for call tagging.
- [x] **Asynchronous Operations:**
  - [x] Leverage RxJS for handling asynchronous data streams.
- [x] **Mock Backend:**
  - [x] A separate mock API server provides the call data.

## üîÅ Advanced Requirements

### NgRx Enhancements

- [ ] Use `NgRx Effects` to fetch call list from a mock API
- [ ] Handle `loading` and `error` states in the store
- [ ] Create `selectors` for:
  - [ ] filtered call list
  - [ ] selected call by ID
  - [ ] loading and error flags

### Call Detail View Enhancements

- [ ] Fetch call data in route resolver or effect
- [ ] Display fallback UI for loading / error

### Role-Based UI (Optional)

- [ ] Add simple role toggle (e.g., `rep` vs `manager`)
- [ ] Restrict some actions to managers (e.g., tagging)

### Performance & Best Practices

- [ ] Use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in all components
- [ ] Replace manual subscriptions with `async` pipe

### Testing

- [ ] Write 1 unit test for a reducer or effect
- [ ] Write 1 unit test for a dumb component

### Large Data Handling

- [ ] Simulate a large dataset (e.g., 500+ calls) to reflect ZoomInfo's scale
- [ ] Implement pagination or virtual scrolling in the dashboard

### Security Awareness

- [ ] Add a basic route guard or role check to simulate access control
- [ ] Prevent access to certain views/actions unless user is "mock logged-in" or has the appropriate role
